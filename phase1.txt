Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

WebAssembly is a relatively new instruction format created to allow web browsers to interpret assembly-like code.
This has many advantages over JavaScript in the browser, as well as applications outside of the browser.
My project idea is to create a compiler from OCaml to WebAssembly.
OCaml is a multi-paradigm language with many features from functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming.
To manage the scope of the project, a core subset of OCaml would be selected and a number of programs demonstrating those features would be created.
Project success is then evaluated by compiling those programs and verifying the WebAssembly output has the desired behaviour.
As an extension, support for features from the multi-core branch of OCaml could be added, allowing programs to use algebraic effect handlers and utilize modern CPUs more efficiently.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.
