# Compiling OCaml to WebAssembly
- what real-world problem your project tries to tackle
   - My project aims to aid efficient software development for the web by allowing programmers to run OCaml in the web

- what was the primary technical challenge
   - The primary technical challenge was implementing a OCaml to WASM compiler

- what you built (the demo)
   - Show it working...

- how you evaluated it
   - Evaluated by taking measurements of the same program executing using different methods: JS_of_ocaml, Vanilla JS

- in what ways / within what limits do your results show that it
addresses the real world problem
   - Meets the success criteria of correctly compiling a set of sample programs. There are lots of limitations and shortcomings of the implementation, but it's a successful proof of concept and starting point for OCaml as a JS alternative in certain circumstances
