\chapter{Preparation}

This chapter describes the work done prior to starting the project.
We start with background information on WebAssembly and the tools and techniques used in the implementation.
Then we will look into the requirements analysis for this project, laying out in detail the work to be done.
Finally, we will look at the software engineering practices used to minimize risk and ensure the execution of the project meets the requirements.
